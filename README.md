# Training-Dataset-Curation-for-SVMs
Support Vector Machines, popularly known as SVMs, have been one of the best machine learning models to
solve classification problems. Although widely used and applied in real-world applications, SVMs are susceptible
to outliers or mislabeled examples in training datasets. The presence of a few anomalies in the training datasets
can affect the decision boundaries created by the SVM model, thereby affecting the modelâ€™s performance on the
unseen data. <br />
A new algorithm is proposed in journal "Training Dataset Curation by L1-norm Principal-Component Analysis for Support Vector Machines" to filter such atypical data instances before the training phase
of SVM and thus retain the good training examples to provide the classifier with better support vector candidates
for making classification boundaries. This data repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the new algorithm proposed in the paper.
